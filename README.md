I'm a passionate developer focused on crafting innovative Windows desktop applications. My projects include:

Audio Converter: Built using the FFmpeg SDK.
Hyper X Browser: An ongoing project based on CefSharp in C#.
Winduster FlatUI Edition: A complete Windows assistant for Windows 10 and above that fixes corrupted files, scans for malware, and more.

I'm currently learning C# WinForms, .NET, and Python, with the ambition to become one of the best software developers. Feel free to reach out at: minterseeker3142@gmail.com
